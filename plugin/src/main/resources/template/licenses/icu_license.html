        <p>5. Time Zone Database</p>
        <p> ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone<br/>
            Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database<br/>
            is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone<br/>
            Database section 7.
        </p>
        <p> # 7. Database Ownership<br/>
            #<br/>
            # The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF<br/>
            # document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work<br/>
            # that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the<br/>
            # public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do<br/>
            # not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make<br/>
            # to it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ<br/>
            # Database, the organization that is providing the IANA<br/>
            # Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of<br/>
            # understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance<br/>
            # with all competent court orders. No ownership claims will be made<br/>
            # by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code. Any person<br/>
            # making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to<br/>
            # future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.
