        <h3><em>Statement of Purpose</em></h3>
        <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
          automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
          (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
          and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
          a database (each, a "Work").</p>
        <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
          to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
          creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the
          public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
          infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
          reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
          whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
          commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
          Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
          production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
          gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
          through the use and efforts of others.</p>
        <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
          without any expectation of additional consideration or
          compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
          "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
          Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects
          to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
          under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
          Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
          effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Copyright and Related Rights.</strong>
          A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
          copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
          Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
          are not limited to, the following:
        </p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
            display, communicate, and translate a Work;</li>
          <li> moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
            performer(s);</li>
          <li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
            image or likeness depicted in a Work;</li>
          <li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
            to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a),
            below;</li>
          <li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
            reuse of data in a Work;</li>
          <li>database rights (such as those arising under Directive
            96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
            March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under
            any national implementation thereof, including any amended
            or successor version of such directive); and</li>
          <li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
            throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
            any national implementations thereof.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>2. Waiver.</strong> To the greatest extent
          permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
          Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
          unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
          Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
          and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
          existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
          the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
          maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
          (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
          future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
          purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
          advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
          makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public
          at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
          successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
          subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
          or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
          enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
          Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Public License Fallback.</strong> Should any
          part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
          ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be
          preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
          Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
          extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
          affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
          sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
          license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
          in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
          maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
          (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
          future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
          purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
          advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The
          License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
          applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
          License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
          ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
          ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
          License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
          she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
          Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
          associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
          Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
          of Purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</strong></p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are
            waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise
            affected by this document.</li>
          <li>Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no

            fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the
            absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present
            or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
            the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.</li>
          <li>Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
            other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
            including without limitation any person's Copyright and
            Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
            responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
            permissions or other rights required for any use of the
            Work.</li>
          <li>Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative
            Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
            obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.</li>

                it is Your responsibility to look at the Agreement regularly for updates. You shall not assign or transfer
                any part of this Agreement to any third party. This Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning
                this license between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between them. If
                any provision of this Agreement is to be held unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed

                and any other agreement governing Your use of the SDK, the terms of this Agreement will control. As used
                herein, the terms “include” and “including” mean “including without limitation.” This Agreement shall be
                governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without reference to
                conflicts of laws principles. The parties agree that the federal and state courts in San Francisco, California
                will have exclusive jurisdiction and venue under this Agreement, and the parties hereby agree to submit to
                such jurisdiction exclusively.
