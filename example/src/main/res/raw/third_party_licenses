CC0 1.0 Universal

  CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

MoPub SDK License Agreement

This MoPub SDK License Agreement (“Agreement”) between you and the company or entity that you represent (“You” or “Your”) and Twitter Inc., successor in interest to MoPub, Inc., and its affiliates, including Twitter International Company (together, “MoPub”) governs Your access and use, in whole or in part, of the MoPub software development kit, including the Android, iOS, and Unity versions of the software development kit, and any related documentation, including the documentation located at /resources/docs/, as may be updated by MoPub from time to time (“Documentation”), code (including sample code), tools, and API(s), including any upgrades, modified versions, updates, additions, and copies of the foregoing licensed to You by MoPub (“collectively, SDK”). By downloading, accessing or using the SDK, You hereby agree to the terms of this Agreement. If You are using the SDK on behalf of an entity, You represent and warrant that You have full legal authority to bind that entity to this Agreement, and by accepting the Agreement or downloading, accessing or using the SDK, You are doing so on behalf of that entity, and all references to You or Your in the Agreement refer to that entity. If You do not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, do not download, access, or use the SDK, or access or use any MoPub Services (as defined below).

1. License.

Subject to Your compliance with this Agreement, MoPub hereby grants You a limited, worldwide, personal, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use the SDK solely for the purpose of using the MoPub Marketplace service and the MoPub ad serving program (collectively, “Services”) solely in the manner permitted by these terms and subject to the MoPub Policies located at www.mopub.com/legal/.

2. Restrictions.

Except as expressly permitted by MoPub, You shall not directly or indirectly (or assist or allow a third party to) (i) distribute, sell, sublicense, rent, loan, lease, or transfer the SDK to any third party, (ii) use the SDK to create or facilitate the creation of any product or service that is competitive with the Service or MoPub, including connecting to any other supply side platform or to any third party ad server using the SDK, or (iii) combine the SDK with other software such that You restrict, impede, circumvent, compromise, impact the functionality of or charge for access to the SDK. Further, if MoPub makes available and You use the SDK in compiled form, You shall not copy (except for backup purposes), decompile, disassemble, translate, reverse engineer, modify, adapt, or create derivative works of the SDK (including the runtime components and any other portions thereof).

3. Device Data.

If You are a publisher, You acknowledge and agree that by accessing or using the SDK and any Services, You agree that the SDK will enable You to exchange information with MoPub, and MoPub may collect and receive information about Your use of the Services and information about Your end users, including end user device information, end user’s browsing behavior and other information as more fully described in the MoPub Policies for Publisher Partners located at www.mopub.com/legal/supply-side-policy/ and the MoPub Privacy Policy located at www.mopub.com/legal/privacy/ (“Device Data”).

You must provide notice to, and where necessary, obtain consent from, Your end users regarding the scope of collection and sharing of Device Data via the Services with MoPub and third parties, including, for example, device identifiers, IP addresses and location information. Unless You have a separate, written agreement with MoPub specifically related to obtaining consent from end users located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland (“EU End Users”), you must display, and obtain consent through, the MoPub SDK’s consent solution, in order to serve personalized advertising to EU End Users. You must not alter or modify the MoPub SDK’s consent solution or otherwise attempt to fraudulently pass consent on behalf of the EU End User. You shall also provide such users with clear notice of, and obtain such users’ consent to, the transfer, storage, and use of their information in the United States and any other country where MoPub, our service providers, and our MoPub Partners (as defined in the MoPub Privacy Policy) operate, and shall further notify such users that the privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the country in which such users live.

You agree that you will not process personal data from EU End Users (or other end users for whom a Publisher Partner has decided to obtain consent) without consent or otherwise process personal data from such end users for purposes beyond that authorized by the consent, unless you have other legal grounds for Your personal data processing.

4. Ownership.

As between the parties, title, ownership, and all intellectual property rights in and to the SDK, and any copies or portions thereof, shall remain with MoPub and its suppliers or licensors. You may not assign or transfer Your rights or obligations granted under this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of MoPub.

6. Updates and Support.

If MoPub makes available any upgrades, patches, enhancements, or fixes for the SDK (“Updates”), such Updates will become part of the SDK and subject to this Agreement.

NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF: (A) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THAT PARTY; (B) FRAUD (INCLUDING FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION); OR (C) ANY LIABILITY WHICH MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED.

9. Termination.

You may terminate this Agreement and the license granted herein at any time by ceasing Your use of the SDK and destroying or removing from all hard drives, networks, and other storage media all copies of the SDK. MoPub may terminate this Agreement and the license granted herein and immediately disable Your use of and access to MoPub Services if You breach any provision of this Agreement.
